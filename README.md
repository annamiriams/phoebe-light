* **[Django Project Structure](https://medium.com/django-unleashed/django-project-structure-a-comprehensive-guide-4b2ddbf2b6b8)**: Helpful to better understand Django project structure and file organization to keep code DRY. [This link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-practice-for-django-project-working-directory-structure/) was also useful.
* **[get_context_data](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/)**: While buidling the Submissions page, I wanted to include both the ability to create a new submission and render a list of previous submissions on the page. ChatGPT suggested I look into get_context_data. Per the docs, get_context_data "returns context data for displaying the object" and I used it accordingly to display details of a user's submissions object.  
* **[related_name](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/models/fields/)**: In rendering both Issue and Submission model data on the home page, I found that using related_name ("the name to use for the reverse filter name from the target model") would allow me to do just that.
